            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis house taking into seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition of this Kingdome at this present, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly wasted, and brought to utter ruine and desolation, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb facs="tcp:160183:3"/> and wicked conspiracies and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of many of the Popish Profession.</p>
            <p>And seeing plainly that the Rebellion was begun under the pretence and colour of Religion, tendeth to the destruction of the Kings Majesty, his heires and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, to draw the Subjects of this Realme, from the subjection and allegiance, which by the Lawes of God and nature, they owe unto his Sacred Majesty, and the Crowne of England.</p>

            <p>For the avoiding therefore of such hurts, perills, dishonours, and inconveniences as at present, and hereafter His Majesty, and this Kingdome do and may suffer by reason of the said Rebellion, stirred up and fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by those; who depend upon the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power, of the Sea of Roome, unjustly claimed and usurped within this Realme; and also of the dangers by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the said usurped power, of whom so many are at this time appearing in open
<pb facs="tcp:160183:3"/> Rebellion now acting such unpareled Cruelties, and unheard of bloody inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities towards the Brittish, and Protestants of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>It is on the considerations aforesaid or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and ordained, that any person that heretofore hath been elected, and now is a Knight, Citizen, or Burgesse for this present Parliament, and now present shall be no longer deemed a Member of this House, or have any voice therein, unlesse he shall forthwith openly in this house accept, and take the oath expressed, and forthwith in one Act made in this Kingdome, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare of Queene ELIZABETH of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory, entituled an Act restoring to the Crowne the antient jurisdiction over the State Ecclesiasticall, and spirituall, and abolishing the forraigne power repugnant to the same according to the tenor and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hereafter following, that is to say.</p>
